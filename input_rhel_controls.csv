System Services,1.5.2 Ensure XD/NX support is enabled,"Recent processors in the x86 family support the ability to prevent code execution on a per memory page basis. Generically and on AMD processors, this ability is called No Execute (NX), while on Intel processors it is called Execute Disable (XD). This ability can help prevent exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated whenever possible. Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is enabled, particularly on 32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such as Itanium and POWER, have included such support since inception and the standard kernel for those platforms supports the feature.",Enabling any feature that can protect against buffer overflow attacks enhances the security of the system.,,"On 32 bit systems install a kernel with PAE support, no installation is required on 64 bit systems:

If necessary configure your bootloader to load the new kernel and reboot the system.

You may need to enable NX or XD support in your bios."
System Services,1.5.3 Ensure address space layout randomization (ASLR) is enabled - sysctl.conf sysctl.d,Address space layout randomization (ASLR) is an exploit mitigation technique which randomly arranges the address space of key data areas of a process.,Randomly placing virtual memory regions will make it difficult to write memory page exploits as the memory placement will be consistently shifting.,,"Set the following parameter in '/etc/sysctl.conf' or a '/etc/sysctl.d/*' file:

When the 'ClientAliveInterval' variable is set, ssh sessions that have no activity for the specified length of time are terminated. When the 'ClientAliveCountMax' variable is set, 'sshd' will send client alive messages at every 'ClientAliveInterval' interval. When the number of consecutive client alive messages are sent with no response from the client, the 'ssh' session is terminated. For example, if the 'ClientAliveInterval' is set to 15 seconds and the 'ClientAliveCountMax' is set to 3, the client 'ssh' session will be terminated after 45 seconds of idle time.","Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's 'ssh' session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening..

While the recommended setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes), set this timeout value based on site policy. The recommended setting for 'ClientAliveCountMax' is 0.

All existing accounts will need to perform a password change to upgrade the stored hashes to the new algorithm.,"The SHA-512 algorithm provides much stronger hashing than MD5, thus providing additional protection to the system by increasing the level of effort for an attacker to successfully determine passwords.

Note that these change only apply to accounts configured on the local system.",,"Edit the '/etc/pam.d/password-auth' and '/etc/pam.d/system-auth' files to include the 'sha512' option for 'pam_unix.so' as shown:

Access Controls,5.4.1.1 Ensure password expiration is 365 days or less,The 'PASS_MAX_DAYS' parameter in '/etc/login.defs' allows an administrator to force passwords to expire once they reach a defined age. It is recommended that the 'PASS_MAX_DAYS' parameter be set to less than or equal to 365 days.,"The window of opportunity for an attacker to leverage compromised credentials or successfully compromise credentials via an online brute force attack is limited by the age of the password. Therefore, reducing the maximum age of a password also reduces an attacker's window of opportunity.",,"Set the 'PASS_MAX_DAYS' parameter to conform to site policy in '/etc/login.defs' :

PASS_MAX_DAYS 90

# chage --maxdays 90"
Access Controls,5.4.1.2 Ensure minimum days between password changes is 7 or more,The 'PASS_MIN_DAYS' parameter in '/etc/login.defs' allows an administrator to prevent users from changing their password until a minimum number of days have passed since the last time the user changed their password. It is recommended that 'PASS_MIN_DAYS' parameter be set to 7 or more days.,"By restricting the frequency of password changes, an administrator can prevent users from repeatedly changing their password in an attempt to circumvent password reuse controls.",,"Set the 'PASS_MIN_DAYS' parameter to 7 in '/etc/login.defs' :

Access Controls,5.4.1.3 Ensure password expiration warning days is 7 or more,The 'PASS_WARN_AGE' parameter in '/etc/login.defs' allows an administrator to notify users that their password will expire in a defined number of days. It is recommended that the 'PASS_WARN_AGE' parameter be set to 7 or more days.,Providing an advance warning that a password will be expiring gives users time to think of a secure password. Users caught unaware may choose a simple password or write it down where it may be discovered.,,"Set the 'PASS_WARN_AGE' parameter to 7 in '/etc/login.defs' :

Access Controls,5.4.1.4 Ensure inactive password lock is 30 days or less,User accounts that have been inactive for over a given period of time can be automatically disabled. It is recommended that accounts that are inactive for 30 days after password expiration be disabled.,Inactive accounts pose a threat to system security since the users are not logging in to notice failed login attempts or other anomalies.,,"Run the following command to set the default password inactivity period to 30 days:

# useradd -D -f 30

Modify user parameters for all users with a password set to match:

Access Controls,5.4.1.5 Ensure all users last password change date is in the past,All users should have a password change date in the past.,"If a users recorded password change date is in the future then they could bypass any set password expiration.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.",,"Investigate any users with a password change date in the future and correct them. Locking the account, expiring the password, or resetting the password manually may be appropriate."
Access Controls,5.4.2 Ensure system accounts are non-login,There are a number of accounts provided with Red Hat 7 that are used to manage applications and are not intended to provide an interactive shell.,"It is important to make sure that accounts that are not being used by regular users are prevented from being used to provide an interactive shell. By default Red Hat 7 sets the password field for these accounts to an invalid string, but it is also recommended that the shell field in the password file be set to '/sbin/nologin' . This prevents the account from potentially being used to run any commands.",,"Set the shell for any accounts returned by the audit script to '/sbin/nologin' :

# usermod -s /sbin/nologin

The following script will automatically set all user shells required to '/sbin/nologin' and lock the 'sync' , 'shutdown' , and 'halt' users:

Access Controls,5.4.3 Ensure default group for the root account is GID 0,The usermod command can be used to specify which group the root user belongs to. This affects permissions of files that are created by the root user.,Using GID 0 for the 'root' account helps prevent 'root' -owned files from accidentally becoming accessible to non-privileged users.,,"Run the following command to set the 'root' user default group to GID '0' :

# usermod -g 0 root"
Access Controls,5.4.4 Ensure default user umask is 027 or more restrictive - /etc/profile /etc/profile.d/*.sh,"The default 'umask' determines the permissions of files created by users. The user creating the file has the discretion of making their files and directories readable by others via the chmod command. Users who wish to allow their files and directories to be readable by others by default may choose a different default umask by inserting the 'umask' command into the standard shell configuration files ( '.profile' , '.bashrc' , etc.) in their home directories.","Setting a very secure default value for 'umask' ensures that users make a conscious choice about their file permissions. A default 'umask' setting of '077' causes files and directories created by users to not be readable by any other user on the system. A 'umask' of '027' would make files and directories readable by users in the same Unix group, while a 'umask' of '022' would make files readable by every user on the system.",,"Edit the '/etc/bashrc', '/etc/profile' and '/etc/profile.d/*.sh' files (and the appropriate files for any other shell supported on your system) and add or edit any umask parameters as follows:

umask 027"
Access Controls,5.4.5 Ensure default user shell timeout is 900 seconds or less - /etc/profile,The default 'TMOUT' determines the shell timeout for users. The TMOUT value is measured in seconds.,Having no timeout value associated with a shell could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's shell session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening.,,"Edit the '/etc/bashrc' and '/etc/profile' files (and the appropriate files for any other shell supported on your system) and add or edit any umask parameters as follows:

TMOUT=600"
Access Controls,5.5 Ensure root login is restricted to system console,The file '/etc/securetty' contains a list of valid terminals that may be logged in directly as root.,"Since the system console has special properties to handle emergency situations, it is important to ensure that the console is in a physically secure location and that unauthorized consoles have not been defined.",,Remove entries for any consoles that are not in a physically secure location.
Access Controls,5.6 Ensure access to the su command is restricted - pam_wheel.so,"The 'su' command allows a user to run a command or shell as another user. The program has been superseded by 'sudo' , which allows for more granular control over privileged access. Normally, the 'su' command can be executed by any user. By uncommenting the 'pam_wheel.so' statement in '/etc/pam.d/su' , the 'su' command will only allow users in the wheel group to execute 'su' .","Restricting the use of 'su' , and using 'sudo' in its place, provides system administrators better control of the escalation of user privileges to execute privileged commands. The sudo utility also provides a better logging and audit mechanism, as it can log each command executed via 'sudo' , whereas 'su' can only record that a user executed the 'su' program.",,"Add the following line to the '/etc/pam.d/su' file:

auth required pam_wheel.so use_uid

Create a comma separated list of users in the wheel statement in the '/etc/group' file:

Filesystem Permissions,6.1.1 Audit system file permissions,"The RPM package manager has a number of useful options. One of these, the '--verify' (or '-V' ) option, can be used to verify that system packages are correctly installed. The '--verify' option can be used to verify a particular package or to verify all system packages. If no output is returned, the package is installed correctly. The following table describes the meaning of output from the verify option:

Code Meaning S File size differs. M File mode differs (includes permissions and file type). 5 The MD5 checksum differs. D The major and minor version numbers differ on a device file. L A mismatch occurs in a link. U The file ownership differs. G The file group owner differs. T The file time (mtime) differs.

The 'rpm -qf' command can be used to determine which package a particular file belongs to. For example the following commands determines which package the '/bin/bash' file belongs to:

# rpm -qf /bin/bash bash-4.1.2-29.el6.x86_64

To verify the settings for the package that controls the '/bin/bash' file, run the following:

# rpm -V bash-4.1.2-29.el6.x86_64 .M....... /bin/bash

Note that you can feed the output of the 'rpm -qf' command to the 'rpm -V' command:

# rpm -V 'rpm -qf /etc/passwd' .M...... c /etc/passwd S.5....T c /etc/printcap",It is important to confirm that packaged system files and directories are maintained with the permissions they were intended to have from the OS vendor.,,

Filesystem Permissions,6.1.10 Ensure no world writable files exist,Unix-based systems support variable settings to control access to files. World writable files are the least secure. See the 'chmod(2)' man page for more information.,Data in world-writable files can be modified and compromised by any user on the system. World writable files may also indicate an incorrectly written script or program that could potentially be the cause of a larger compromise to the system's integrity.,,"Removing write access for the 'other' category ( 'chmod o-w ' ) is advisable, but always consult relevant vendor documentation to avoid breaking any application dependencies on a given file."
Filesystem Permissions,6.1.11 Ensure no unowned files or directories exist,Sometimes when administrators delete users from the password file they neglect to remove all files owned by those users from the system.,"A new user who is assigned the deleted user's user ID or group ID may then end up 'owning' these files, and thus have more access on the system than was intended.",,"Locate files that are owned by users or groups not listed in the system configuration files, and reset the ownership of these files to some active user on the system as appropriate."
